## Problem Description
Our data model is designed to address common challenges faced by small used vehicle dealerships, such as keeping track of inventory, preventing errors in availability, and managing sales records. The system maintains detailed information about each vehicle, including identifying details, pricing, and availability status, ensuring the dealership always knows which cars are on the lot and which have been sold. Once a sale occurs, the model links the vehicle to the employee who completed the sale and updates its status. By also recording customer information, the system helps with follow-ups and future marketing opportunities. Overall, the model improves efficiency, increases accountability, and provides valuable insights into both sales performance and inventory management.



## Queries
1. Query 1 retrieves all information about cars that are from 2021 and newer. If a customer wants a newer car this is a helpful query to be able to quickly retrieve the information about what cars are less than 5 years old.
